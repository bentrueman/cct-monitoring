	abstract = {In this paper, we discuss an extension to two popular approaches to modeling complex structures in ecological data: the generalized additive model (GAM) and the hierarchical model (HGLM). The hierarchical GAM (HGAM), allows modeling of nonlinear functional relationships between covariates and outcomes where the shape of the function itself varies between different grouping levels. We describe the theoretical connection between HGAMs, HGLMs, and GAMs, explain how to model different assumptions about the degree of intergroup variability in functional response, and show how HGAMs can be readily fitted using existing GAM software, the
              mgcv
              package in R. We also discuss computational and statistical issues with fitting these models, and demonstrate how to fit HGAMs on example data. All code and data used to generate this paper are available at:

              ii

          , 
            
              Silicates have been added to drinking water for decades, mainly to control colour by dispersing oxidized iron and manganese. Silicates have been used occasionally to control lead release, but there is no consensus on whether they are effective. Moreover, there are concerns that silicates may disperse particulate lead. We evaluated the effect of sodium silicate on lead release from a model lead(
              ii
              ) carbonate powder using a continuous-flow stirred-tank reactor. We tested a wide range of pH and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations (pH 7.5 or 9, and 5 or 50 mg C per L). We compared sodium silicate against an inhibitor-free control, a better-characterized inhibitor (orthophosphate), and a widely used sequestrant (polyphosphate). Sodium silicate did not have a statistically significant impact on lead release at pH 7.5, regardless of the DIC concentration. At pH 9 it accompanied 80\% more lead release at 5 mg C per L and 21\% less lead release at 50 mg C per L, compared with controls at matched pH and DIC settings. Sodium silicate did not influence the crystalline phase composition, but it did adsorb to lead(
              ii
              ) carbonate. This may account for its effects at pH 9. Orthophosphate was the more effective inhibitor, yielding 33–96\% less lead release than matched controls. Orthophosphate inhibition was attributed to conversion from lead(
              ii
              ) carbonate to hydroxylpyromorphite (Pb
              5
              (PO
              4
              )
              3
              OH) and adsorption to lead(
              ii
              ) carbonate in the absence of a phase conversion (
              i.e.
              , at pH 9 with 50 mg C per L). Polyphosphate increased lead release by 540–4100\%, likely due to aqueous complexation and possibly due to colloidal dispersion.},

      abstract = { 4500-Cl− A. Introduction 1. Occurrence Chloride, in the form of chloride (Cl−) ion, is one of the major inorganic anions in water and wastewater. The salty taste produced by chloride concentrations is variable and depends on the chemical composition of water. Some waters containing 250 mg/L Cl− may have a detectable salty taste if the cation is sodium. On the other hand, the typical salty taste may be absent in waters containing as much as 1000 mg/L when the predominant cations are calcium and magnesium. The chloride concentration is higher in wastewater than in raw water because sodium chloride (NaCl) is a common dietary component and passes unchanged through the digestive system. Along the sea coast, chloride may be present in high concentrations because of leakage of salt water into the sewerage system. Chloride also may be increased by industrial processes. A high chloride content may harm metallic pipes and structures, as well as growing plants. }

    abstract = { 5310 A. Introduction 1. General Discussion Organic carbon in environmental and other water matrices may exist in a variety of oxidation states. Some of these compounds can be oxidized further via biological or chemical processes. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), carbonaceous BOD (CBOD), biodegradable organic carbon (BOC), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total organic carbon (TOC) analytical methods may be used to characterize these fractions. Total organic carbon provides a more convenient and direct expression of total organic content than BOD, CBOD, BOC, or COD. Analyses of TOC provide a measurement of the organic content of a sample that is independent of the organic matter’s oxidation state and does not measure other organically bound elements (e.g., nitrogen and hydrogen) or inorganics that can contribute to the oxygen demand measured by BOD and COD. The amount of TOC in water sources may be used to define the matrix and its quality and can range from ≤0.1 to 25 mg/L in drinking water to ≥300 mg/L in wastewater influent and industrial effluents. Although none of these techniques (BOD, BOC, COD, TOC) are direct correlates of each other, several studies have demonstrated that correlations can be developed between any pair of them and TOC can be used as a surrogate for some of these other parameters in certain cases. This has been acceptable under some regulatory frameworks including National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits. The regulatory authority to develop a correlation is found in the Clean Water Act 40 CFR § 133.104(b) (sampling and test procedures); however, no methods are provided for establishing a long-term correlation or other repeatable empirical relationship. A correlation provides a measure of the strength of association between two continuous variables. Regression quantifies the effect of one continuous variable on another dependent continuous variable. A long-term study consists of a minimum of one year of samples collected no less than once weekly to capture seasonal variations in operating conditions. For regions with little to no seasonal variation, studies shorter than one year may be sufficient. Although a correlation establishes a relationship, regression establishes an equation to quantify the relationship that can be used to report a calculated value for the dependent variable. Correlation coefficients provide a metric of the strength of association between two variables. Generally, those greater than 0.50 but less than 0.70 indicate a moderately weak to strong correlation and those greater than 0.70 are sufficiently strong and indicative of an empirical relationship. These relationships may need to be established independently for each set of matrix conditions (e.g., various points in a treatment process and water types). Organic contaminants in water may degrade ion-exchange capacity, serve as a carbon or energy source for undesired biological growth, react with disinfectants to form byproducts that could harm human health or aquatic organisms, or be otherwise detrimental to the water’s purpose. Before organically bound carbon can be analyzed, the molecules must be converted into carbon dioxide (CO2), a molecular form that can be measured quantitatively. Current TOC methods use one of the following means of oxidation to convert organic carbon into carbon dioxide: • high temperature combustion (typically 680 to 1200 °C) with or without catalysts and oxygen or air, • heated persulfate (typically 95 to 100 °C) with one or more chemical oxidants and catalyst, • UV irradiation with one or more chemical oxidants, or • supercritical water oxidation (typically 375 °C and 22.1 MPa) with chemical oxidant. The CO2 may be purged from the sample, dried, and transferred via carrier gas to a nondispersive infrared analyzer or coulometric titrator. Alternatively, CO2 may be separated from the sample via a CO2-selective membrane into high-purity water, where the increase in conductivity corresponds to the amount of CO2 passing through the membrane. }

              via
              drinking water is a public health concern. Modeling can account for solubility due to simple inorganic ligands but generally falls short in capturing the effects of natural organic matter, particles, and colloids; environmental data are needed to understand the importance of these species. Here, we demonstrate the use of asymmetric flow field flow fractionation with UV and ICP-MS detection to separate drinking water samples into ionic species, colloids, and metal–organic complexes. Colloidal iron appeared to be more important as a transport vector for lead, copper, and manganese than natural organic matter: estimated colloidal metals concentrations (Pb, Cu, Fe, Mn {\textgreater}1000 kDa) were at least 3 times greater than concentrations of these metals associated with the high apparent molecular weight (∼1 kDa) organic signal. In transmission electron micrographs, two distinct populations of relatively dense colloids in the size range 50–200 nm were apparent, with morphologies typical of environmental iron oxides. Moreover, energy dispersive spectroscopy showed that sample colloids were rich in iron, copper, and oxygen. At equilibrium (
              e.g.
              , during long stagnation periods in plumbing), high molecular weight organic and colloidal fractions represent additional capacity for drinking water to transport lead, which could have implications for water treatment to limit lead exposure.},

          , 
            
              Lead is a potent neurotoxin and drinking water represents an important route of exposure, especially where legacy lead pipe is widespread. Polyphosphates are often added to drinking water to sequester iron and calcium, but they may form coordination complexes with lead, increasing its solubility. This risk is not well characterized in practice: the prevalence of lead-polyphosphate complexes in drinking water systems is not known. We used size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) with multi-element (ICP-MS) detection to compare the speciation of lead below 0.45 μm in two low-alkalinity water systems dosing phosphate-based corrosion inhibitors at different ortho : poly ratios and doses. In one system dosing polyphosphate at 0.05 mg P L
              −1
              (3 : 1 ratio), it reverted almost completely to orthophosphate during distribution. In another system dosing polyphosphate at 0.20 mg P L
              −1
              (1 : 1 ratio), it was detectable at points of use. Under the influence of polyphosphate, lead and iron were present as dissolved species strongly associated with phosphorus. Moreover, experiments with sodium hexametaphosphate confirmed our ability to detect lead as a coordination complex using SEC. In the absence of polyphosphate, lead and iron were present as colloidal particles. Orthophosphate on its own also appeared to reduce lead solubility, as estimated using paired sample profiles collected at seventeen single-unit residences.

            Methods. Between July 2020 and October 2021, we enrolled 4005 facilities in a grant-funded, participatory science testing program. We identified risk factors associated with elevated first-draw lead levels using multiple logistic regression analysis.
            Results. By sample (n = 22 943), 3\% of tap water sources exceeded the 10 parts per billion (ppb) North Carolina hazard level, whereas 25\% of tap water sources exceeded 1 ppb, the American Academy of Pediatrics’ reference level. By facility, at least 1 tap water source exceeded 1 ppb and 10 ppb at 56\% and 12\% of facilities, respectively. Well water reliance was the largest risk factor, followed by participation in Head Start programs and building age. We observed large variability between tap water sources within the same facility.
            Conclusions. Tap water in child care facilities is a potential lead exposure source for children. Given variability among tap water sources, it is imperative to test every source used for drinking and cooking so appropriate action can be taken to protect children’s health.
