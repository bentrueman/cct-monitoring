# Lead pipe scale analysis

This section describes our procedure for identifying crystalline phases in three lead pipe samples recovered from three sites in Zone 2.

## Scale extraction  

Lead pipe samples were excavated carefully, sealed at either end, and delivered to the laboratory. We cut a 0.2 m long section from each sample with a hacksaw, and we cut each section in half longitudinally to reveal the interior. Pipe interiors were photographed, and corrosion scale was collected with a stainless steel spatula in discrete layers, differentiated by colour, texture, and distance from the pipe wall. Pipe samples yielded distinct outer (L1), middle (L2), and inner (L3--L4) layers. The collected scale was finely ground with a mortar and pestle, which was cleaned with dilute nitric acid and pure water between samples. 

## X-ray diffraction 

We identified crystalline phases in the scale samples using a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer with a copper K$\alpha$ radiation source. The X-ray tube was operated at 35 kV and 30 mA. Scans were acquired over the range 10 - 70&deg; (2$\theta$) with a step size of 0.04&deg; and a scan speed of 0.8 &deg; min^-1^. Diffraction patterns were compared against the standard powder diffraction files listed in Table S2.

```{r table-s2}

tibble::tribble(
  ~Phase, ~`PDF entry no.`,
  "Chloropyromorphite", "96-900-4202",
  "Hydroxypyromorphite", "00-086-0236",
  "Hydrocerussite", "96-201-2741",
  "Cerussite", "00-047-1734",
  "Litharge", "00-085-1739",
  "Lead", "96-900-8478"
) %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption = "**Table S2.** Standard X-ray diffraction patterns and their powder diffraction file entry numbers.")

```

## Results

Corrosion scale in the first pipe was highly crystalline (Figure 3a). The top two scale layers were dominated by a pyromorphite mineral, and the bottom layer contained hydrocerussite and pyromorphite. While the best-matching pyromorphite mineral was chloropyromorphite (Pb~3~(CO~3~)~2~(OH)~2~), standard diffraction patterns for chloro- and hydroxyl- pyromorphites are quite similar, and our match to chloro-pyromorphite is tentative. We identified it based on two key differences: 1) between 29.5 and 30.5 degrees (2$\theta$), chloropyromorphite yields two peaks to hydroxypyromorphite's one, and between 45 and 47 degrees, chloropyromorphite yields three clearly separated peaks to hydroxypyromorphite's two [@lytle_inhibition_2009]. 

Pipes extracted at the other two sites 2--3 had similar corrosion scale to that of site 1 (Figure 3b--c, respectively). A pyromorphite mineral was present, although the match to chloropyromorphite was even less certain here than in the XRD patterns representing site 1. XRD patterns also matched the lead carbonates hydrocerussite (sites 2--3) and cerussite (site 2), as well as the lead oxide litharge (site 3).
